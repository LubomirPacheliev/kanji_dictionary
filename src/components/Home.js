            <p>Japanese writing is known for being hard and tedious to learn. Many are intimidated by the complexity of the characters.  That, combined with the sheer amount of them, tends to put off new learners. But the truth is, it’s actually not hard at all. It can even be fun! You just need to take the right approach.
