                Seemingly a sailor who is amnesiac about all details of his personal life.
                For some reason he has FOUR TESTICLES?!?! The real identity of this character
                is unknown. The second chapter stated that the <a href="">ジョジョの奇妙な冒険</a> protagonist's
                name could be <a href="">冒険冒険</a>, however it is later revealed that he is merely a
                doppelanger for the real <a href="">冒険冒険</a>. He was later given the name <a href="">冒険冒険</a>
                by the <a href="">冒険</a> family, who took him in.
